Today I learned something simple and cool.

I can use R and Python in the same document with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
To post using different engines, I just need to use the `engine` option in the code chunk.

For example, to use R, I just need to use `engine = "r"` in the yaml of the post.
To use Python, I just need to use `engine = "python"`.
