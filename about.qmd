::: {.intro}
I'm a data scientist, a master of numbers and patterns. 

I surf on waves of structured and unstructured data, hunting for meaningful insights that can transform how businesses operate. 

I find the stories hidden in data and bring them to life using advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. 

When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me exploring the latest AI trends, or drinking some beer, maybe both. 

I also love to playing games, reading books and watching movies.

Welcome to my digital space, where data comes to life!
