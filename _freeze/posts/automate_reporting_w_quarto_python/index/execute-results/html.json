For the purpose of this article, we will be using VSCode with Quarto to develope this project. \n\nYou can follow the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) tutorial to install Quarto and the VSCode extension.\n\nAfter you have your quarto extention installed, you can create a new project by clicking on the Quarto icon on the left side of the VSCode window and then clicking on the \"New Project\" button.\n\n![Create New Project](imgs/create_new_project.png)\n\n![Select Default Project](imgs/select_type_project.png)\n\n![Create New Folder](imgs/create_new_folder.png)\n\nAfter that, you will see something like this:\n\n![Starting structure](imgs/lets_start.png)\n\nAs you can see we have 2 files. `_quarto.yml` and `automate_reporting.qmd`. \n\nTo make our lives easy we will install a pretty cool quarto extention called [PrettyPDF](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/making-pretty-pdf-quarto/), which will help us to make our pdf reports look better. To install the quarto extension and use the template file:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nquarto use template nrennie/PrettyPDF\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Install the template](imgs/install_template.png)\n\nAnd finally, lets create a envoirement for this project.\n\nI am on Mac so this is the command:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npython3 -m venv .venv\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd to finish this part, I'll just create the folder structure we will be using for this project.\n\n![Folder structure](imgs/folder_structure.png)\n\n# Creating the report\n\n",
